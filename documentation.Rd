\description{
This is a reactive map of the U.S. Each county in the U.S. will appear color coded based on the racial demographic information that you input.
}
\usage{
To operate the App-1 Shiny app, you must first install the following libraries: shiny, maps, and mapproj.

Choose a demographic segment that you are interested from the radio button array: White, Black, Hispanic, or Asian. The correlative information will appear in the U.S. map on the right.

Displayed population percentages can be narrowed or widened using the slider on the left. Displaying a narrower range of population percentages will alter the color representation on the map for easier viewing.

This Shiny app is based on a project produced on the shiny.r.com website. It uses or directly references information and code from the Shiny app documentation and tutorials at shiny.r.com.

This app and all of its supporting code was created by the author, but many elements of the app and its code will appear similar to its basis app.
